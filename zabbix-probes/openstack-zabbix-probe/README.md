1 Main Features
-----------------
This probe works by getting the list of available providers and, for each Openstack API available, a VM is created, inspected and deleted, as a way to confirm that the main operations to be done are working as expected in the provider under evaluation. The probe is able to monitor several providers concurrently and it sends all the gathered metrics to the Zabbix server collecting all the information.

2 Pre-Requisites
------------------
Not fulfilling these requisites will have a negative impact in the execution of the probes.

* It requires a CMDB available, so it will be possible to retrieve the list of available providers. Having no access to a CMDB means that the probe will not be able to retrieve a list of providers to monitor, therefore not doing anything;

Since the implementation of the probe is in Java, it requires, Java8 JVM to be already installed.

3 Installation
----------------

First of all, make sure the main dependencies of the probes are available: the JRE. If this is not the case, they can be installed following a few simple steps.

In order to install the JRE:
* Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install default-jre
```

* CentOS:
```
sudo yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk
```

Then, it is necessary to install the corresponding packages:

* Ubuntu:
```
wget https://github.com/indigo-dc/Monitoring/raw/master/zabbix-probes/openstack-zabbix-probe/openstack-zabbix-probe-1.01.jar
```

Although the probes can be run just on demand, the best option is to configure them as Cron jobs. That can be configured by editing the configuration file with the following command:
```
crontab -e
```

Then, add the following lines:
```
0 * * * * java -jar /usr/share/java/zabbix/openstack-zabbix-probe-1.01-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

This means that the probe will run every hour at xx:00. Modify this configuration according to your needs, so the probes will run when required.

4 Configuration
----------------- 

The Openstack probe requires to modify the openstackprobe.properties (inserted in /etc/zabbix/ for linux systems in C:\zabbixconfig\ for Windows ones) file in order to set the following parameters:
* java.keystore - Set here the full location of the security certificates keystore
* cmdb.location - Provide the full URL of the CMDB component, providing the information about the available providers
* wait.real.vm.creation - Provides the user to get information about the real creation response time of a machine or just the immediate response from the client
* is-iam-authenticated - If set to true the probe trye authetnticating itself to Openstack via IAM 
* zabbix.wrapper.location - The endpoint where zabbix wrapper exposes APIs at.

If skypping Iam authentication to providers, just make sure to insert the credentials of openstack tenant (where the probe tries creating, deleting and inspecting the instances) inside oszones.yml file located at the same path as openstackprobe.properties.

5 Packages Update
-------------------
If a previous version of the packages is already installed, it is necessary to update them to the new version. That can be done through the following commands.

* Ubuntu:
```
wget https://github.com/indigo-dc/Monitoring/raw/master/zabbix-probes/openstack-zabbix-probe/openstack-zabbix-probe-1.01.jar
```

6 Potential Issues
--------------------
In the case of providers requiring some communication using SSL, if the provider certificate is not signed by a known entity, the JVM may throw exceptions. In such case, it is necessary to register the corresponding certificate with the following command:
```
keytool -importcert -trustcacerts -alias infnkeystone -file infnkeystone.cer -keystore "%JAVA_HOME%/jre/lib/security/cacerts"
```
